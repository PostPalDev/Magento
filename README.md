PostPal Magento Plugin
======================


This extension will connect your online store to the PostPal crowdsourced on-demand courier service. With PostPal, your customers have the option to get their order delivered within an average time under one hour.
Once the client pays for the order, a closest available courier will be automatically sent to pick up the package at the first opening time of your warehouse.
